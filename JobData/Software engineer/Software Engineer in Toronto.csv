The Presence pillar creates industry-leading designs for Stripe’s front door surfaces, educates customers about the power of our platform, and drives our business success. The Platform pillar builds the internal machinery that powers these surfaces, and is responsible for making our websites fast, stable, and easy to modify.WPP offers exciting opportunities to have a major impact on Stripe’s success, as stripe.com is often a user’s first impression of the company, and the vast majority of signups come via the website.
