We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customized approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organization. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with offices in more than 90 cities in 50 countries. For more information, please visit bcg.com.BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.The success of our assignments routinely leads our clients to maintain long-term relationships with us. Over 85 percent of our revenues come from clients who continue to work with us from one year to the next to maintain the momentum for change and to continually improve bottom-line results they have achieved with our help.We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.What You'll DoBoston Consulting Group offers you an unparalleled opportunity for both personal and professional growth and development. No two experiences are alike and the skills you acquire will position you for success within and outside of BCG.BCG is staffed by consultants who combine industry experience with acute strategic and analytical skills. They come from a variety of backgrounds, reflecting the diversity of perspective we value. Most assignments involve one or more teams of three to six BCGers; specifically, the typical BCG team is made up of one to two partners, a project manager, and several consultants/associates who work with a similar group of client staff. The standard team combines consultants with relevant technical and industry backgrounds with others who have functional and strategic skills. We also strive to incorporate a mix of seniority and skills to balance the capabilities needed for the project with a sound budget plan. We create value by customizing our approach to complement client capabilities and the issues at hand.We believe consulting is a process, not a product. Our goal is to guide, develop, facilitate, and enrich each client's strategy development process. Our consulting practice depends on close teamwork between the client's organization and our staff. Clients often remark that a valuable and unusual aspect of working with BCG is the firm's commitment to joint discovery of insights and strategies, and to building the experience base and skills of its client's organization. Team interaction centers on intensive analysis of objective data and open discussion of logic and conclusions. This type of collaborative work is complemented by objective research of the competitive environment, including competitor analysis and capability benchmarking.Our teams work with client members from all levels of the organization in order to integrate our staff's strategy, operational, and industry experience with the client's knowledge of its particular situation, culture, and constraints. To ensure follow-through by a client, we find it vital to closely link BCG's senior managers with the highest level of the client's organization responsible for acting on the outcomes of our involvement.Individual assignments can last anywhere from two to twelve months or more, depending on the complexity of the challenges and the client's needs. We usually break each project into modular phases so that our clients see results well before the engagement's end. Assignments normally proceed through three stages over a period of several months: 1) identifying and analyzing opportunities for change and laying out different options for senior management to consider, 2) fleshing out the best options in order to create detailed action plans, and 3) assisting in execution. We believe that working with a client until results are assured is vital to their success.Boston Consulting Group is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
